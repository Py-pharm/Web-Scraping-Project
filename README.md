# Web-Scraping-Project

[Hotels.ng](https://hotels.ng/) s an online travel agency specializing in hotel bookings within Nigeria. They help customers book hotel rooms online, provide comprehensive help and support to their clients and make the hotel booking process smooth and easy. They also provide hotel recommendations and reviews, making sure that clients stay in good, clean, and safe hotels all over the country.

In this project, I gathered important information about hotels in Port Harcourt city using the python web scraping library - Beautiful Soup.

The information include; hotel name, price per night, facilities, address, and so on.

I transformed the scrapped information into a Dataframe and saved it in csv format to be used for important analysis.
